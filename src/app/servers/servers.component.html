<!-- Some events give you data when they are fired.  This data can be captured by passing $event as an argument -->
<input
    type="text"

    (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)">

<p class="my-3">{{ serverName }}&nbsp;</p>

<!-- By property binding by using [ ], we are setting the disabled property natively... -->
<!-- ...which is something that the regular disabled HTML attribute doesn't do. -->
<!-- Since the disabled property uses a bool, we set true or false based on the variable we declared in the TS. -->
<!-- Parenthesis ( ) define an event binding.  If we want to catch and do something with an event, do this -->
<button [disabled]="!allowNewServer" class="btn btn-primary" (click)="onCreateServer()">
    Add Server
</button>

<p>{{ serverCreationStatus }}</p>

















<!-- Sometimes you can use either string interpolation or property binding -->
<!-- <p>{{ allowNewServer }}</p>
<p [innerText]="allowNewServer"></p> -->

<!-- Use string interpolation if you want to print out string values -->
<!-- Use property binding if you want to change the properties of an element -->
<!-- DON'T MIX THE TWO! -->
